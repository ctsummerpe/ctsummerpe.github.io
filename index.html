      <h2>Seven-minute workouts.</h2>
      <p>I completed seven so-called seven-minute workouts. In this case, &ldquo;seven-minute workout&rdquo; was something of a misnomer, as the workouts generally lasted a bit over eight minutes: as such, this amounted to a total of <span class="time">60 minutes</span>. Seven-minute workouts are an activity which I can practice throughout my life for the purpose of improving my health, choosing an appropriate level of difficulty.</p>
